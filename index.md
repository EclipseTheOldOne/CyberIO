## Data Transimission
### Sender & Receiver
![Sender&Receiver](PlumStarInc/Sender&Receiver.gif)

Sender&Receiver can be connected each other thanks to the Internet of Things(IoT). Of course, they still need electricity like other gadgets.

Because Sender&Receiver use peer to peer(P2P), one sender can only connects with one receiver, while one receiver could establish more connections.

They will automatically detect whether there is any data flowed and display the state on its screen.
### Streaming

Plum Star Inc. built the universe's largest streaming server. That supports you startup server on your own, as the server you built is just a (Content delivery network)CDN server of it.
### Intelligent Logistics

Smart unloader will detect the requirement of a receiver, or a smart distributor in this case, then unload the surrounding containers and send corresponding data to the target.
Smart distributor only allows the data that factorys nearby need.

Therefore, combining them appropriately could boost the productivity of your industries.

## Holographic Projection
### Holograpgic Projector

Holographic projector consumes cyberion, a liquid, and projects countless holographic units.
There are many different kinds of holo-units, such as holo-miner and holo-fighter, who can perform various arduous tasks for you.

When it comes to the little one, they ~~are cute~~ can do many dirt works, but unfortunately, they are disposable, because cyberion in their images is consumed over time.

Nevertheless, they are cheap and it's the best choice to assist you.


More holographic units are still in development, please continue following the progress of Plum Star Inc.
